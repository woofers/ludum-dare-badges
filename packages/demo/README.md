# Usage


### Running Locally

Running locally for development can be done with:

-   `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the required modules.
-   `yarn dev` or `npm dev` to host locally in development mode.

Now going to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) will display the site.


## Building for Deployment

Building the static site can be done with:

-   `yarn build` or `npm build`.

A `public` folder will be generated with the created bundle.
